Nodes to run: 
    joy/joy_node
    drive/joycontrol
    drive/deviceconnect
    drive/motornode

joy_node is provided by ros and interfaces with our joystick
See the following link for how to configure it:
http://wiki.ros.org/joy/Tutorials/ConfiguringALinuxJoystick
Basically:
rosparam set joy_node/dev "/dev/input/jsX"
Where jsX is the appropriate controller device
then rosrun joy joy_node



drive/joycontrol is our own interface which sends commands to the motors

drive/deviceconnect allows us to link usb devices to motornodes

Usage:
There exists a file files.txt which tells deviceconnect what device to connect where
Each line has two items, a device name and connection seperated by a comma
Running deviceconnect without anythihng in the file will tell you what devices are connected and their connection (should be number dash number: #-#)

The device name in files.txt should be the same name as in motornode.py (see the bottom of the file) followed by 'device'
So if the motornode is named 'left', inside files.txt the device name should read 'leftdevice' and the connection should be #-#

Running deviceconnect and motornode should then allow the motors to be controlled through the motornode's subscribers
