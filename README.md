# ROS-Main

To run ROS with UI, you must download and install rqt (http://wiki.ros.org/rqt), which I believe comes with default packages. Launch RQT by typing rqt into shell (after running roscore), then go to perspectives tab, click on import, then locate ui.perspective under ROS-Main/user_interface/config directory
