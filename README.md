# ROS-Main

This respository should be your src file in your ROS workspace.  So when cloning, call
  `git clone .... src`
from your workspace


##Starting everything up
The easiest way is to simply call the bash script `launch_simulated.sh` from the folder launchscripts


##Setup and usage for usb_cam submodule

Once you have cloned your repository, if you intend on working with the USB cameras, you will need to initialize and update the usb_cam submodule.  To do so, simply run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
This will clone the usb_cam pakage into the correct directory.  You will then need to run `catkin_make` to build the new package and it should be ready to go

To start getting your images from the camera, you need to run the usb_cam_node as follows:
```
rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node _video_device:=[path to your video device, /dev/video0 by default]
```
The full list of parameters appear [here](http://wiki.ros.org/usb_cam), others that may be useful might by image_width and image_height.
This node publishes images to `usb_cam/image_raw` in all supported image_transport formats (raw, compressed, compressedDepth, and theora).

To test that you have it setup correctly, you can view the video stream using the built in image_view node as follows:
```
rosrun image_view image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw
```

# RQT Mini Tutorial

To run ROS with UI, you must download and install rqt (http://wiki.ros.org/rqt), which I believe comes with default packages. Launch RQT by typing rqt into shell (after running roscore), then go to perspectives tab, click on import, then locate ui.perspective under ROS-Main/user_interface/config directory


# Other stuff

sudo apt install usb_cam
